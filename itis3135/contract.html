        <p class="paragraph text-sm centered">
          I, Luke D Tucich, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
          in my Fall 2025, ITIS 3135, Web-Based Application Design and
          Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I
          understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools
          will be available to the world, and will not put information there
          that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm centered">
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
          logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in
          assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm centered">
          I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
          it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’
          code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
          and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given
          credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
