        <p class="paragraph text-sm">
          I’m Luke, 20 years old, born in Asheboro, North Carolina. As a kid, I
          loved drawing, painting, playing with Legos, and experimenting with
          the computer. This mix of creativity and technology inspired me to
          pursue software engineering. I enjoy problem-solving and creating,
          which makes computer science feel natural and rewarding. Outside of
          programming, I enjoy cooking, weightlifting, playing chess, rock
          climbing, and biking.

        <h3 class="text-md">professional background</h3>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm">
          I’m relatively new to tech, having only started programming in April
          2024. Since then, I’ve self-learned extensively, completing The Odin
          Project to catch up on modern web development and computer science
          fundamentals. I’ve gained experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
          Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. After a long application process, I
          finally landed a Software Engineering internship at Walmart for Summer
          2026. Right now, I’m learning Go and Python to strengthen my backend
          skills.

      <section>
        <h3 class="text-md">academic background</h3>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm">
          I’m pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in
          Web/Mobile Development & Software Engineering. After high school, I
          attended Sandhills Community College and earned an Associate’s in
          Science, focusing on math and science courses like calculus and
          chemistry. Along with AP credit, this saved me a year of school, but
          it also sped up my timeline, making the transition to UNC Charlotte a
          wake-up call to take my learning seriously. I’m currently classified
          as a senior by credits, with about three semesters left.
