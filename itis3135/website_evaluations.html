      <!-- Good Website -->
      <section>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm">
          Stripe is basically the go-to payment processor for online businesses.
          Their website does double duty - showing off their product and helping
          developers figure out how to actually use it. It's clean, modern, and
          actually makes payment processing look kinda cool.
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph text-sm styled-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> Stripe absolutely nails contrast. They
            keep it simple with white backgrounds and dark text, then pop in
            that signature purple color to make important stuff stand out.
            Everything's super readable, and you can actually tell what's
            clickable without squinting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> They're super consistent across the
            whole site. Same fonts everywhere, same button styles, same purple
            color popping up in all the right places. It feels like one cohesive
            experience instead of a bunch of random pages thrown together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything lines up perfectly. It's like
            they used an invisible grid system and actually stuck to it. No
            wonky spacing or weird positioning - everything feels intentional
            and organized. It's the kind of site that just looks professional.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> They group related stuff together really
            well. Navigation stays in one spot, content sections are clearly
            separated, and there's enough white space so nothing feels cramped.
            You can scan the page and immediately understand what's what.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Bad Website -->
      <section>
        <h3>
          <a href="http://www.pnwx.com" target="_blank"
            >Pacific Northwest X-Ray</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph text-sm">
          Pacific Northwest X-Ray sells medical equipment, mostly X-ray machines
          and stuff like that. Their website is supposed to help doctors and
          hospitals find what they need, but honestly it's a bit of a mess. It's
          like they built it in 2005 and never updated it.
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph text-sm styled-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> This site is a contrast disaster. They've
            got red text on blue backgrounds, yellow text that's basically
            invisible on white, and busy patterns that make everything harder to
            read. It's like they picked colors out of a hat and went with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> There's zero consistency here. Every
            page looks different - different fonts, different colors, different
            layouts. The navigation changes from page to page, and there's no
            real branding to speak of. It's like they let everyone design their
            own page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing lines up properly. Text blocks
            are all over the place, images are crooked, and the navigation looks
            like it was thrown together by someone who's never used a computer
            before. It's chaotic and honestly kind of stressful to look at.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related stuff is scattered everywhere.
            Navigation links are hiding in random places, unrelated content is
            mixed together, and there's no clear organization. You have to hunt
            through a bunch of random information just to find what you're
            looking for. It's exhausting.
